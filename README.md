# React My Reads Project

Project developed for [React Nanodegree at Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
The bootstrap of this project was forked from this [repo](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

For the bootstrap and setup [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) was used.

## The Project

The project consists in a stateful frontend application, responsible for management of a personal library.
It contains a series of shelves that hold books in different states. For example

```
- Books that I'm currently reading
- Books that I want to read
- Books that I've read already
```

It is possible to move a book from one shelf to another as well as remove it from the shelf visualization (like a deletion).

To add new books on the available shelves, there is a search page that allows the user to search new titles and select one of the shelves directly from the results.
